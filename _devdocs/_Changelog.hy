In preparation for 0.4.0:
- removed `with_execution_time`, replaced with simplier `timing`
- removed `curry`, `rcurry` and `autocurry` (similar `partial` is enough for fptk needs)
- added `resultM` module
- renamed `write_file` to `write_to_file`
- fptk source is now splitted into several files (tests/scripts upd accrodingly)
