# Generator of fptk local

This script creates `_fptk_local.hy` by uniting files from `/src` into one single file.
Generated files are places to `/_etc/local_versions/`

This is needed for using `_fptk_local.hy` in other projects to have stable fptk inside them.
This is until fptk will reach stable release.
